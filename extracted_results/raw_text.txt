Mean Blood Glucose

Explanation:- 
•
Total haemoglobin A1 c is continuously synthesized in the red blood cell throught its 120 days life span. The concentration of HBA1c in the cell
reflects the average blood glucose concentration it encounters.
•
The level of HBA1c increases proportionately in patients with uncontrolled diabetes. It reflects the average blood glucose concentration over an
extended time period and remains unaffected by short-term fluctuations in blood glucose levels.
•
The measurement of HbA1c can serve as a convenient test for evaluating the adequacy of diabetic control and in preventing various diabetic
complications. Because the average half life of a red blood cell is sixty days, HbA1c has been accepted as a measurement which reflects the mean 
daily blood glucose concentration, better than fasting blood glucose determination, and the degree of carbohydrate imbalance over the preceding
two months.
•
It may also provide a better index of control of the diabetic patient without resorting to glucose loading procedures.
HbA1c assay Interferences: 
Erroneous values might be obtained from samples with abnormally elevated quantities of other Haemoglobins as a result of 
either their simultaneous elution with HbA1c (HbF) or differences in their glycation from that of HbA (HbS).

Microalbumin (per urine volume)
mg/L
< 16.7
Immunoturbidimetric
10.50
In random urine specimens, normal urinary albumin excretion is below 17 mg/g creatinine for males and below 25 mg/g creatinine for females.(3)
Microalbuminuria is defined as an albumin:creatinine ratio of 17 to 299 for males and 25 to 299 for females.
A ratio of albumin:creatinine of 300 or higher is indicative of overt proteinuria.
Due to biologic variability, positive results should be confirmed by a second, first-morning random or 24-hour timed urine specimen. If there is 
discrepancy, a third specimen is recommended. When 2 out of 3 results are in the microalbuminuria range, this is evidence for incipient nephropathy 
and warrants increased efforts at glucose control, blood pressure control, and institution of therapy with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitor (if the patient can tolerate it).

Summary and Uses:
•
Total Hcy is a thiol-containing amino acid, produced by the intracellular demethylation of methionine to
cysteine.
•
Elevated levels of t Hcy may be used to exclude or confirm deficiencies of vitamin B12 or folate.
•
It is recommended to test in patients using medications that interfere with folate status (methotrexate,
antiepileptics), vegetarians without  B12 supplementations, unexplained anemia, peripheral neuropathy or
myleopathy, recurrent spontaneous abortions or infertility.
•
Testing also recommended for patients 40 years of age with coronary artery disease to exclude
homocystinuria.
•
Elevations in tHcy levels have also been used as an independent risk factor of coronary or cerebral
vascular disease. Treatment of moderate hyperhomocystinemia with folic acid supplementation for primary
and secondary cardiovascular protection has met with inconsistent results and at present cannot be
routinely recommended.
Limitations:
•
The plasma must be seprated immediately on collection to avoid continuous synthesis of Hcy  by red cells.
•
Samples must be immediately stored on ice and serum centrifuged immediately before a complete clot is
formed.
•
Certain drugs, such as anticonvulsants, methotrexate, or nitrous oxide, may interfere with the assay.
•
Cigarette smoking and coffee consumption increase tHcy levels.
•
Intraindividual variability is approximately 8%; it can be as much as 25% in patients with
hyperhomocystinemia.
•
Generally, a single measurement of tHcy is considered adequate.

Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin and exists in two main forms as cholecalciferol(vitamin D3) which is synthesized in skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol in 
response to sunlight exposure & Ergocalciferol(vitamin D2) present mainly in dietary sources.Both cholecalciferol & Ergocalciferol are converted to 
25(OH)vitamin D in liver.
Interpretation:
Increased In
•
Vitamin D intoxication
•
Excessive exposure to sunlight
Decreased In
•
Malabsorption
•
Steatorrhea
•
Dietary osteomalacia, anticonvulsant osteomalacia
•
Biliary and portal cirrhosis
•
Thyrotoxicosis
•
Pancreatic insufficiency
•
Celiac disease
•
Rickets
•
Alzheimer disease
Limitations:
More recently, it has become clear that receptors for vitamin D are present in a wide variety of cells and that this hormone has biologic effects extending 
beyond the control of mineral metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency is not clear. Levels needed to prevent rickets and osteomalacia (15 ng/mL) are lower 
than those that dramatically suppress parathyroid hormone levels (20–30 ng/mL). In turn, those levels are lower than levels needed to optimize intestinal 
calcium absorption (34 ng/mL). Neuromuscular peak performance is associated with levels approximately 38 ng/mL. A recent study states that 
increasing mean baseline levels from 29 to 38 ng/mL was associated with a 50% lower risk for colon cancer and levels of 52 ng/mL with a 50% reduction 
in the incidence of breast cancer. It is recommended to have clinical correlation with serum 25(OH)vitamin D, serum calcium, serum PTH & serum 
alkaline phosphatase.

Vitamin B12
L
pg/mL
187 - 833
CLIA
< 148
Vitamin B12 is essential in DNA synthesis, hematopoiesis, and CNS integrity.
Interpretation:
•
Increased In      :      Chronic granulocytic leukemia , COPD and Chronic renal failure ,  Leukocytosis ,   Liver cell damage (hepatitis, cirrhosis) , Obesity and 
Severe CHF ,  Polycythemia vera , Protein malnutrition.
•
Decreased In     :   Abnormalities of cobalamin transport or metabolism  , Bacterial overgrowth ,  Crohn disease  ,   Dietary deficiency (e.g. in vegetarians) 
,  Diphyllobothrium (fish tapeworm)   infestation  ,  Gastric or small intestine surgery  , Hypochlorhydria   ,  Inflammatory bowel diseas , Intestinal 
malabsorption and Intrinsic factor deficiency
Limitations:
•
Drugs such as chloral hydrate increase vitamin B12 levels. On the other hand , alcohol, aminosalicylic acid, anticonvulsants, ascorbic acid,
cholestyramine, cimetidine, colchicines, metformin, neomycin, oral contraceptives, ranitidine, and triamterene decrease vitamin B12 levels.
•
The evaluation of macrocytic anemia requires measurements of both vitamin B12 and folate levels; ideally they should be measured
simultaneously.
•
Specimen collection soon after blood transfusion can falsely increase vitamin B12 levels.
•
Patients taking vitamin B12 supplementation may have misleading results.
•
A normal serum concentration of B12 does not rule out tissue deficiency of vitamin B12. The most sensitive test for B12 deficiency at the
cellular level is the assay for MMA. If clinical symptoms suggest deficiency, measurement of MMA and homocysteine should be considered,
even if serum B12 concentrations are normal.

PSA-Prostate Specific Antigen, Total
ng/mL
0 - 4
0.573
PSA is a glycoprotein that is expresses by both normal and neoplastic prostate tissue and is prostate tissue specific and not prostate cancer specific. 
PSA is constantly expressed in nearly all prastate cancers, although its level of expression on a percell basis is lower than in normal prostate epithelium. 
The absolute value of serum PSA is useful for determining the extent of prostate cancer and assessing the response to prostate cancer treatment; its 
use as a screening method to detect prostate cancer is also common.
Interpretation
Increased in
•
Prostate disease (Cancer, Prostatitis, Benign prostatic hyperplasia, Acute urinary retention)
•
Manipulations ( Cystoscopy, Needle biopsy, Radiation therapy, Indwelling catheter, Prostatic massage)
•
Transurethral resection
•
Prostatic ischemia
Decreased in
•
Castration
•
Prostatectomy
•
Radiation therapy
•
Ejaculation withi 24 - 48 hours
•
5-alpha-reductase inhibitor reduces PSA by 50% after 6 months in men without cancer
Limitations
•
PSA has been recommended by the American Cancer Society for use in conjunction with a DRE for early detection of prostate cancer starting
at the age of 50 years for men with at least 10 year life expectancy
•
PSA levels that are measured repeatedly over time may vary because of biologic variability where the true PSA level in a given man is different
on different measurements.
•
A change in PSA of >30% in man with a PSA initially below 2.0 ng/mL was likely to indicate a true change beyond normal random variation.

CLIA
492.30
 IgE mediates allergic and hypersensitivity reactions. There is a significant overlap in total IgE between  allergic and nonallergic individuals.
Interpretation:
- Increased In
•
Atopic  diseases
◦
Exogenous asthama in approximately 60% of patients
◦
Hay fever in approximately 30% of patients and Atopic eczema
•
Influenced by type of allergen, duration of stimulation. Presence of symptoms, and hyposensitization treatment
•
Parasitic diseases (e.g. ascariasis, visceral larva migrans, hookworm disease, schistosomiasis, Echinococcus infestation)
•
Monoclonal IgE myeloma
- Decreased In
•
Hereditary deficiencies
•
Acquired immunodeficiency
•
Ataxia-telangiectasis
•
Non-IgE myeloma
Limitations:
•
A normal level of IgE in serum does not eliminate the possibility of allergic disease.
•
Serum total IgE levels for the majority of individuals with IgE-mediated disease can be expected to be elevated compared to the reference
range for healthy adults. However, not all allergic patients exhibit elevated serum total IgE levels.
•
Since not all atopic reactions are IgE-mediated,  a total IgE result in the reference range  should always be interpreted in light of other clinical
observations.
•
Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with the immunoglobulins included in the assay components causing interference with in vitro 
immunoassays.

Additional Information:
1.
A NON REACTIVE result implies that no Anti HIV-1 or HIV -2 antibodies have been detected in the sample by this method. This means that either
the patient has not been exposed to HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection or the sample has been tested during the "WINDOW PHASE" (before the
development of detectable levels of antibodies).
2.
A PROVISIONALITY REACTIVE / BORDERLINE REACTIVE result suggests possibility of HIV-1 or/and HIV-2 infection. However these results
must be verified by confirmatory WESTERN BLOT / HIV PCR method before declaring the patient positive for HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection.
3.
Very high levels of IgM Antibodies or Anti-HLA ABC and DR Antibodies can give false positive reaction.
**Pre & Post test counselling for HIV testing is responsibility of reffering Physician.

Interpretation
Negative for typical beta thalassemia trait.
Interpretation:
•
All results have to be correlated with age and history of blood transfusion if there is history of blood transfusion in last 3 months, repeat testing
after 3 month from last date of transfusion is recommended.
•
In case of haemoglobinopathy, parents or family studies and councelling is advised.
•
This test detects beta thalassaemia and haemoglobinopathies, DNA analysis is recommended to rule out alpha thalassaemia and silent
carriers.
•
Linearity range of HbF is 1-40%, However, values in excess of the reportable range have been provided for ease of interpretation.
•
Mild to moderate increase in fetal haemoglobiin can be seen in some acquired condition like pregnancy, megaloblastic anaemia, Throtoxicosis,
Hypoxia, Chronic kidney disease, Recovering marrow, MDS, Aplastic anaemia, PNH, Medications (Hydrocyurea, Erythropoietin) ect.
•
P3 window-Above 10% is often indicative of either denatured froms of hemoglobins or may suggest a possibility of abnormal haemoglobin
variant. Hence, repeat analysis with fresh sample or DNA studies is advised.
•
P2 Window-Above 10% is indicative of either glycated haemoglonin requring correlation with diabetic staus or may suggest a possibility of
abnormal haemoglobin variant further DNA studies for confirmation.
